# Wish-A-Burger (Devour the Burger!)



## Description

This is an web app built in the MVC Design pattern, using node, Express,  Handlebars, MySQL and ORM.   The user gets to see a list of burgers waiting to be devoured, and burgers already devoured.  When the user clicks the button of the burger it can switch from waiting to be devoured to devoured, and the other way around. There is also an option to delete the burgers, or add a new one.
